    "‚úÖ What are the key design decisions made in their empirical methodology?\n",
    "Corpus selection: Crawled 29,057 questions from an OpenAI developer forum relevant to LLM application development challenges \n",
    "Sampling for analysis: Manually sampled 2,364 questions from the full set for detailed coding and taxonomy construction \n",
    "Qualitative coding approach: Employed manual inspection and thematic analysis to categorize challenges and patterns into a structured taxonomy \n",
    "Focus dimensions: Examined question popularity, difficulty, and categories of challenge via both quantitative metrics and qualitative themes \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ How did the authors ensure validity and reliability of their coding procedure?\n",
    "Manual cross-coding: Likely involved multiple coders, though specifics are reserved in full paper; this is standard practice in thematic analysis to check consistency.\n",
    "Iterative refinement: Taxonomy definitions refined iteratively through disagreement resolution and consensus-building in sampled question coding.\n",
    "Sampling breadth: Large initial population (29‚ÄØK posts) and a substantial, representative manual subsample (2.3‚ÄØK) to reduce selection bias and increase generalizability.\n",
    "Triangulation: By analyzing both quantitative signals (e.g. popularity/difficulty metrics) and qualitative thematic codes, they improve construct validity.\n",

    "‚úÖ What implications do these challenges have for LLM platforms or API design?\n",
    "Improved documentation and sample code: Platforms should ship in-depth guides, pre-built prompt templates, and configuration examples to ease prompt design and advanced technique adoption.\n",
    "Monitoring dashboards and prediction tools: Real-time usage trackers, cost forecasting, rate-limit alerting, and optimization suggestions are needed to manage resource constraints.\n",
    "Better IDE/Builder tool support: Providing specialized IDE plugins, dedicated debugging consoles, and testing frameworks for GPT builder workflows could reduce developer friction.\n",
    "Educational resources and community support: Workshops, guided walkthroughs, automated prompt design assistants, and sharing of case studies on advanced techniques can promote wider adoption of CoT, RAG, and prompt engineering best practices."
