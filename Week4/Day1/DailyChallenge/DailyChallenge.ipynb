    "What is Machine Learning and Why is it Important?\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. For data analysts, ML is vital because it helps extract deeper insights, make accurate predictions, and automate tasks that would otherwise require manual analysis. By leveraging ML, analysts can turn raw data into actionable knowledge, enabling better decision-making and innovation."
