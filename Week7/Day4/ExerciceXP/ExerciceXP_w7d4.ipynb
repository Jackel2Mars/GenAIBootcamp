    "Exercise 1: Comparative Analysis Of Generative AI And Traditional AI\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of generative AI compared to traditional AI in complex scenarios.\n",
    "For each of the following real-world scenarios, determine whether generative AI or traditional AI would be more suitable. Provide a detailed justification, considering factors such as accuracy, creativity, efficiency, ethical concerns, and computational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automated Medical Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "A hospital wants to implement an AI system to detect lung cancer from X-ray images. Should they use a traditional AI classification model or a generative AI approach that can synthesize new medical images for training?\n",
    "2. Legal Document Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "A law firm wants an AI system that drafts legally binding contracts with minimal human intervention. Should they use a rule-based system (traditional AI) or a generative AI language model? What are the risks involved?\n",

    "1) Automated medical diagnosis (lung cancer on X‑rays)\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary choice: Traditional discriminative vision model (e.g., CNN/ViT classifier or detector/segmenter) trained on rigorously curated real data.\n",
    "Role for generative AI: Data augmentation & rare-case synthesis, semi-supervised pretraining (self-supervised or generative) — but not as the decision-making model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy & robustness: Regulators and clinicians need calibrated, well-characterized error rates. Discriminative models are easier to validate on real held-out cohorts. Generative models may introduce distribution shift or subtle artifacts that a classifier then overfits to.\n",
    "Creativity: Not desired. You want faithful pattern recognition, not imagination.\n",
    "Efficiency & compute: Training large generative models (diffusion, GANs) to make useful high-fidelity medical images is costly. Classic supervised/self-supervised discriminative pipelines are cheaper to train and deploy.\n",
    "Ethics & regulation: Synthetic-data–trained systems are harder to justify to regulators and can mask bias (e.g., if the generator under-represents certain demographics or disease stages).\n",
    "Bottom line: Use a traditional classifier/segmenter; optionally add generative augmentation to balance classes or simulate rare phenotypes, and prove it actually helps on real external test sets.\n",
    "2) Legal document generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary choice: Hybrid: Generative AI (LLM) for drafting + symbolic/rule-based validators, templates, and RAG for grounding, constraint checking, and up-to-date law.\n",
    "(So, not pure traditional AI, but also not a free-form LLM on its own.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy & rigidity: Law is highly structured; rule engines and contract templates ensure compliance with required clauses and jurisdictional constraints.\n",
    "Creativity: You rarely want “creative” contracts; you want complete, consistent, enforceable ones. But natural-language variation and tailoring to bespoke terms is where LLMs shine.\n",
    "Efficiency: LLMs can accelerate drafting massively; the rule/RAG layer reduces hallucinations and ensures current statutes/precedents are referenced.\n",
    "Ethics & liability: Hallucinated clauses, missing mandatory terms, or misapplied jurisdiction create legal risk. You need audit trails, strong human-in-the-loop review, and deterministic post-generation checks.\n",
    "Compute costs: Serving a mid/large LLM with retrieval is costlier than a pure rules engine, but still far cheaper than full human drafting—and acceptable if you cache, distill, or fine-tune smaller models.\n",
    "Bottom line: Use an LLM to draft; enforce correctness with RAG, schema-constrained generation, rule-based validation, and mandatory human review.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) AI-generated scientific research (literature reviews + new hypotheses)\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary choice: Two-track system\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization: Generative AI with retrieval (RAG) and citation grounding to produce faithful, attributed summaries. Traditional extractive summarizers are safer but often too shallow for nuanced synthesis.\n",
    "Hypothesis generation: Generative AI can be a brainstorming assistant, but outputs must be flagged as speculative and evaluated by humans (and ideally, by automated consistency/feasibility checks).\n",
    "Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: RAG + citation verification mitigates hallucinations. Pure generative without grounding is risky.\n",
    "Creativity: Hypothesis generation benefits from generative models’ ability to connect distant ideas; traditional methods don’t “invent” much.\n",
    "Efficiency: LLMs can read and synthesize thousands of papers quickly; traditional NLP pipelines (topic modeling, tf-idf, basic extractive summarization) scale well but deliver less insight.\n",
    "Ethics: Plagiarism detection, correct attribution, and transparency about model limitations are essential.\n",
    "Compute cost: Running RAG-augmented LLMs is pricier than classic NLP, but still tractable and often worth it for the quality of synthesis.\n",
    "Bottom line: Use generative AI—tightly grounded—for summarization; allow it to suggest hypotheses but keep humans (and possibly symbolic consistency checks) in the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Financial market prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary choice: Traditional (and modern non-generative) predictive models — e.g., ARIMA/Prophet, gradient boosting, random forests, LSTMs/Transformers trained discriminatively, plus econometric models.\n",
    "Role for generative AI: Scenario simulation, synthetic data for stress testing, and unstructured data ingestion (news, filings, earnings calls → embeddings/sentiment → fed into the traditional forecast stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy & stationarity: Markets are non-stationary. Generative models trained on the past can confidently hallucinate patterns that don’t hold in new regimes.\n",
    "Creativity: Unwelcome in the prediction itself; you want calibration, backtestability, and risk control.\n",
    "Efficiency & compute: Training big generative models for time series is expensive and rarely beats strong discriminative baselines + good features + risk management.\n",
    "Ethics/compliance: Explainability and auditability are crucial for regulators and LPs; traditional models + feature attributions are easier to defend.\n",
    "Edge case: Generative LLMs are quite useful to digest text (10‑Ks, news, social feeds) and convert it into structured signals.\n",
    "Bottom line: Rely on traditional/discriminative forecasting; add generative components upstream (text understanding) or offline (stress testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Autonomous vehicle decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary choice: Traditional AV stack (discriminative perception + model-predictive control / rule-based planners + formal verification where possible).\n",
    "Role for generative AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation & rare-corner-case generation (to improve training and validation).\n",
    "World models / generative scene prediction in research settings — but tightly bounded and with safety monitors, not as a sole decision policy.\n",
    "Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy & safety: AVs need deterministic, verifiable behavior with strict latency budgets. Current generative policies are hard to certify.\n",
    "Creativity: Not desired on-road; you want predictable, legally compliant actions.\n",
    "Efficiency & compute: Real-time planning and control must be low-latency and power-efficient; large generative models can be too heavy and unpredictable.\n",
    "Ethics & governance: Decisions involving harm allocation must be transparent, policy-driven, and auditable—better handled via explicit rule/optimization frameworks than opaque generative reasoning.\n",
    "Bottom line: Keep the decision core traditional and verifiable; use generative AI offline (or in supervised auxiliary roles) to expose the system to long-tail events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-cutting pattern to decide “Generative vs Traditional”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask these five questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we need creativity or language generation?\n",
    "Yes → generative (plus guardrails).\n",
    "No → traditional/discriminative.\n",
    "Is the task safety-/regulation-critical with strict validation needs?\n",
    "Yes → traditional first; generative only as augmentation, never as the final arbiter.\n",
    "Can we fully ground the model in authoritative data (RAG, templates, constraints)?\n",
    "If yes, generative becomes safer.\n",
    "If no, favor traditional or hybrid with strong post-checkers.\n",
    "Are latency, determinism, and verifiability hard constraints?\n",
    "Yes → traditional / symbolic / MPC.\n",
    "No → generative may be acceptable.\n",
    "Is compute budget tight?\n",
    "Heavy generative models are expensive to train/serve; traditional models often win on cost-performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical diagnosis, AV decision-making: Traditional for the deployed model; generative helps off the critical path (pretraining, augmentation, simulation).\n",
    "Legal drafting: Hybrid — generative to draft, traditional (rules/RAG) to constrain and validate.\n",
    "Scientific reviews: Generative (with grounding) for summarization + ideation; traditional methods alone miss nuance.\n",
    "Finance forecasting: Traditional/discriminative for the core predictive task; generative to mine text and create stress scenarios."

    "1. Synthetic Medical Image Generation\n",
    "For generating synthetic MRI scans to train machine learning models while preserving patient privacy, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are generally preferred over VAEs (Variational Autoencoders).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why GANs?\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs typically produce higher-quality, more realistic images with sharper details, which is crucial for medical imaging where subtle features matter.\n",
    "They excel at capturing complex data distributions, leading to synthetic images that closely resemble real MRI scans, thus improving the downstream model’s training effectiveness.\n",
    "Why not VAEs?\n",
    "\n",
    "VAEs generate images by approximating the data distribution, but often produce blurrier or less detailed outputs, which might not capture fine-grained structures important for accurate diagnosis.\n",
    "However, VAEs are sometimes preferred for their stable training and explicit latent space, which can be useful for certain applications but less critical here.\n",
    "Conclusion: Given the need for realistic and accurate synthetic MRI scans, GANs are better suited despite their more challenging training process."

    "For detecting fraudulent transactions by modeling normal purchase patterns, VAEs are generally more effective than GANs. VAEs explicitly learn a probabilistic latent representation of normal behavior, enabling them to reconstruct typical transactions well and identify deviations as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",

VAEs provide a more stable and interpretable framework for capturing the distribution of normal transactions and spotting unusual patterns as reconstruction errors.\n",
