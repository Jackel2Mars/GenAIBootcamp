            "- Â“I just felt like it really kind of changed where people were a little bit, definitely in the '90s, a lot more quiet, into themselves, and then it started to become better.Â” Meanwhile, Federer is hoping he can improve his service game as he hunts his ninth Swiss Indoors title this week.\n",

            "- Â“I was on a nice trajectorythen,Â” Reid recalled.Â“If I hadnÂ’t got sick, I think I could have started pushing towards the second week at the slams and then who knows.Â” Duringa comeback attempt some five years later, Reid added Bernard Tomic and 2018 US Open Federer slayer John Millman to his list of career scalps.\n"
